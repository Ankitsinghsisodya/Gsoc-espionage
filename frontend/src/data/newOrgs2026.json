    "description": "Boa is an open-source, embeddable JavaScript engine written in Rust. The project aims to provide a correct, safe, and performant implementation of the ECMAScript specification, with a strong focus on long-term maintainability and developer ergonomics.\n\nBoa is designed to be used as a library, enabling developers to embed JavaScript into Rust applications, tooling, and experimental runtimes. The project emphasizes clear internal architecture, rigorous testing, and close alignment with the evolving ECMAScript standard.\n\nDevelopment is community-driven and spans multiple areas of language runtime engineering, including parsing, bytecode compilation, virtual machine execution, garbage collection, performance optimization, and specification conformance. Boa is actively developed and used as a platform for exploring modern JavaScript engine design in a memory-safe systems programming language.\n\nIn 2026 Boa's work has been used in browsers such as Google Chrome and Node.js to implement Temporal, you can read more about this in https://boajs.dev/blog/2025/09/24/temporal-release. Boa has also been used as an implementation to help drive standards within TC39 (the standards committee behind JavaScript).",

Since it's landed upstream, it has been widely deployed to billions of devices, and addresses various target scenarios. Nowadays, almost all Linux mainstream distributions support EROFS.\n\nEROFS has become a recommended filesystem [2] for Android system partitions and has already been adopted by the majority of Android vendors. It has also become popular in the Linux container world. For example, Composefs [3] uses the EROFS format for its metadata tree. Containerd 2.1 [4] also officially includes a built-in EROFS support to boost container launch performance. gVisor now supports EROFS as well [5].\n\n[1] https://erofs.docs.kernel.org\n[2] https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/erofs\n[3] https://github.com/containers/composefs\n[4] https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.1.0\n[5] https://github.com/google/gvisor/pull/9486",

    "description": "MalariaGEN is a global network of global partners who share and integrate data relevant to inform malaria surveillance, our mission is to generate insights and tools that bridge the gaps for analysts in malaria endemic settings to use their data meaningfully to inform public health efforts. We build and optimise data resources and analytical tools to run directly in the cloud. Our flagship project is the Vector Observatory, which includes whole-genome sequence data for over 30,000 mosquitoes, integrating data from 70 partners across the globe from over 17 different mosquito species -- this is the largest resource on genetic variation data for any multicellular organism (other than humans!). Our goal is to enable analysts, scientists, students and public health practitioners to access these data without the need for any dedicated compute infrastructure, by optimising our resources to run within free compute environments (a big shout to Google Colab!) and by developing training resources that support partners to get confident with using cloud-native data and resources for their analysis.",
